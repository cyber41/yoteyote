		<h1>Nikita CMS - Admin Dashboard</h1>

		<p>
			The easiest Authentication Library just got easier to use because now it comes bundled with an administration backend that
			allows you to add, edit and delete user accounts.
		</p>

		<h2>Notice</h2>

		<p>
			Because of the new administration panel, The Authentication Library has become an application. As a result of this the number
			of files used in The Authentication Library has grown. Most of these files are simply views, but there are now two controllers
			used by The Authentication Library that are <strong>required</strong> if you wish to use the administration panel.
			These controllers are located in <dfn>controllers/admin/</dfn>
		</p>

		<h2>The admin controller</h2>

		<p>
			The admin controller - located at <dfn>controllers/admin/admin.php</dfn> - is used to show the user their dashboard. At the moment
			this simply welcomes the user as what would go here is totally application specific. This is required if you wish to use the
			administration panel dashboard. Feel free to add to this as you see fit for your application.
		</p>

		<h2>The users controller</h2>

		<p>
			The users controller is used to control the user management part of the admin panel. It enables you to add, edit and delete user accounts.
			Feel free to add to or edit the controller to suit your needs.
		</p>

		<h2>The Layout</h2>

		<p>
			The administration layout is very simple and was not made with any other template in mind. Any resemblance is pure coincidence.
			The CSS for the panel is in the view <dfn>views/auth/header.php</dfn> and the template can be changed to suit the needs of you
			or your client. The panel should be easy to change to fit in with an existing panel.
		</p>

		<h2>Adding to the panel</h2>

		<p>
			Aside from creating a new controller or adding to an existing one, you'll need to add your views into the <dfn>views/auth/pages/</dfn> folder.
			You can include the page you need with the panel's headers and footers using the following functions.
		</p>

		<pre class="code">
			$this->auth->view('<var>$name_of_your_file</var>');
		</pre>

		<h2>Building on top of the Admin Panel</h2>

		<h3>Create a controller</h3>

		<p>
			If you want to build on top of the admin panel (and it is highly likely that you will) — you need to do a new things. The first thing you'll
			need to do is create a new controller for your addition. In this example we'll add a task manager. So you will create a new file in
			<var>controllers/admin/</var> called <var>tasks.php</var>. This controller should extend the Application class.
		</p>

		<h4>A typical constructor</h4>

		<p>
			Your constructor for additional addons to the admin panel should look something like this, you can restrict the addon to either user group
			and a model is not necessary.
		</p>

		<pre class="code">
			function Tasks()
			{
				parent::Application();
				$this->auth->restrict('admin'); // restrict this controller to admins only
				$this->load->model($this->models."taskmodel", 'tasks'); // Load the task model - gets lists of users etc
			}
		</pre>

		<h3>Create a navigation item</h3>

		<p>
			The next step is to add a new navigation item. Open up <var>views/auth/nav.php</var> and add a new list item with a link to the correct
			URI string for your addition, in this example case it will be admin/tasks or even admin/tasks/manage if you have set up a manage function.
		</p>

		<h3>Placing and using view files</h3>

		<p>
			The view files should be located at <var>views/auth/pages</var> — you should bunch your view files into a folder to keep it easy to
			navigate and go through at a later stage. You can include your view files by using the function provided, an example is below.
		</p>

		<pre class="code">
			$this->auth->view('tasks/manage');
		</pre>
